# Ember Process Exporter Configuration
# Simple grouping by command name to avoid high cardinality
# Captures per-process CPU and memory metrics

process_names:
  # Group all processes by their command name (executable basename)
  # This provides visibility into resource usage without excessive cardinality
  - name: "{{.Comm}}"
    cmdline:
      - '.+'

  # Alternatively, you can define specific process groups for finer control:
  # Uncomment and customize as needed
